Hello!

This is HoosBuying -- a platform made by, and built for college students who want to trade, barter, or give away their belongings as they go through college. 

I worked on this project with my roommate, Vlad, as a final project for our Databases class at the University of Virginia.

Since I worked with a partner, I provided a breakdown of the features I was responsible for:
* Connecting the Flask API and our Google Cloud-hosted MySQL database to the Vue.js front-end
* Authentication
  * Log In/Sign In Flow
  * Authenticating User Tokens (We authenticated users with an in-house JWT)
* Routing & NavBar 
* Platform Features
  * Set-up Search Page and supporting API Calls and SQL Scripts so Users could search Listings
  * Set-up Listing Page so Users could create their own and view others' listings and wrote the supporting API Calls and SQL Scripts
  * Set-up Tags so Users could look through classes of products at a time
  * Set-up Conversations between Users and saved the Messages Users sent between them to our Database
